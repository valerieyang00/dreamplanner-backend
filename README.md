# Dream Planner
Everyone has a dream vacation in their bucketlist.  We're here to bring those dreams closer to reality with a budget tracker.  Users can post and share their dream vacation and calculate how much they need to save each week.  Once the user goes on their vacation, they can add actual expenses to the trips.

## Our Approach Used
We used the Miro to create the User Stories and mapped out the RESTful Routes.  We implemented a SCRUM dashboard using sticky notes.  

We set up the backend and designed a rough draft of how we wanted our site to look.  Then we tackled the front end routes to reach MVP.  After we got the site functional, we styled it with Tailwind.

We had daily stand ups with a checklist of Big Milestones and daily goals.  We ranked each item from high to low priority.  We tested and dedugged daily to polish the site until we were satisfied. 

## Tech Stack Used
- Django
- React
- Python
- PostgreSQL
- JavaScript
- Git and GitHub
- Tailwind
- Axios

## MVP goals
- [X] User can create, read update, delete profile
- [X] User can create, read, update, delete destination details.
- [X] User can create, read, update, delete expense from a destination.
- [X] Learn Django for react
- [X] Wire Framing
- [X] Task Tracking
- [X] CSS - Tailwind 

## Stretch Goals
- [X] API 
- [X] Expense Dashboard
- [ ] Social Page (view friends)
- [ ] Profile Photo
- [ ] Comments


## Major Hurdles 
A major hurdle we had to overcome was installing the backend with the jwt token.  We also learned how to use json fixtures with python.  We were able to implement the dashboard using an npm package & tailwind.  We're really proud of the last few days of styling with tailwind.
